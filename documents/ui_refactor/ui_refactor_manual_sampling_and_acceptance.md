# Vesti UI Refactor Manual Sampling and Acceptance (v1.4)

Version: v1.1  
Status: QA Gate Spec  
Audience: QA, release owner, frontend, UI design

---

## 1. Sampling Coverage

Minimum mandatory set:
- 4 top-level regions x 3 scenario types = 12 base cases
- plus 4 Threads->Reader child-flow cases
- plus 20 cross-cutting interaction and boundary cases
- total minimum: 36 cases

Scenario types:
1. standard ready state
2. loading/empty/error state
3. primary action path

---

## 2. Region Matrix (Mandatory)

Regions:
- Threads
- Insights
- Data
- Settings

Per region must validate:
- information hierarchy readability
- primary action discoverability
- state rendering consistency

Threads child flow (mandatory):
- open Reader from thread card
- Reader back navigation to Threads list
- selected conversation context continuity
- refresh behavior after `VESTI_DATA_UPDATED`

---

## 3. Cross-Cutting Scenarios (Minimum 20)

1. Keyboard navigation end-to-end.
2. Focus-visible correctness for icon buttons.
3. Card action row click precision.
4. Long-title truncation behavior.
5. Mixed-language text rendering (EN + 中文).
6. Platform tag contrast and consistency.
7. Small viewport density check.
8. Center action availability in mirror/smart/manual modes.
9. Center action disabled reason copy correctness.
10. KB entry exists in Insights header and nowhere else as structural entry.
11. Compaction trigger in Threads + compaction stats in Data.
12. External links placed in Settings only.
13. Threads full-text search: query hits title, no `Matched in messages` hint.
14. Threads full-text search: query hits only message body, hint appears.
15. Query length 1 does not trigger body-scan behavior; result remains title/snippet-only.
16. Right navigation rail width remains `52px` and main content area expansion is visually preserved.
17. Settings shows three group labels in order: Personalisation -> System -> Support.
18. Settings Language row is `Soon`, non-expandable, and does not show accordion affordance.
19. Support block has exactly three rows (Docs & Help / Send Feedback / What's New), not accordion cards.
20. Send Feedback row toggles inline reveal correctly; email copy action and issue-link path are available.
21. Threads / Insights / Data / Settings page titles use one unified 18px title role and aligned top spacing.
22. Insights top header has no extra gray divider line under the title.
23. Threads top header does not render duplicated brand logo/wordmark (Dock logo remains unchanged).
24. Threads search button opens inline search input; `Cancel` and `Esc` both exit search mode.

## 4. Required Evidence per Case (DoD)

Each case must include:
- Case ID, region, scenario
- expected/actual/verdict
- timestamp
- screenshot
- if action case: short interaction log

For regression-sensitive cases, include:
- pre-refactor screenshot reference
- post-refactor screenshot

For full-text search cases, include:
- search query string and expected hit source (title/snippet/body)
- screenshot proof of `Matched in messages` hint presence/absence

For navigation-rail calibration case, include:
- screenshot or DevTools evidence showing rail width is `52px` on sidepanel root

For Settings support-density cases, include:
- screenshot evidence for three-group label order and three support rows
- link-target verification for README and Releases destinations
- inline reveal open/close evidence and email copy result feedback

---

## 5. Severity and Release Gate

Severity:
- Blocker:
  - critical action unreachable
  - data-destructive action guard missing
  - page unusable due to layout break
  - IA boundary violation causing misplacement of core function
- Major:
  - wrong state rendering
  - accessibility path broken
  - repeated interaction misfire
- Minor:
  - visual inconsistency without functional impact

Go/No-Go threshold:
- `Blocker = 0`
- `Major <= 2` with owner + workaround + retest plan

---

## 6. Build Gate

Required:
- `pnpm -C frontend build`
- `pnpm -C frontend package`

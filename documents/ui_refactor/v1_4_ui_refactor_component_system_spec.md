# Vesti v1.4 UI Refactor Component System Spec

Version: v1.1  
Status: Decision Complete  
Scope: Component architecture, visual tokens, and interaction contracts

---

## 1. Component Tiers

Tier A (app shell)
- `VestiSidepanel`
- `Dock`
- center action affordance (logo button)

Tier B (top-level regions)
- Threads region (`timeline` route id in code)
- `InsightsPage`
- `DataPage`
- `SettingsPage`

Tier B child flow
- `ReaderView` (Threads drill-down only)

Tier C (reusable units)
- `ConversationCard`
- `MessageBubble`
- `PlatformTag`
- `SearchInput`
- `StructuredSummaryCard`
- `StructuredWeeklyCard`
- `DataManagementPanel`

## 2. Token Contract

Source files:
- `frontend/src/style.css`
- `frontend/tailwind.config.ts`

Rules:
1. All colors come from semantic tokens; avoid hard-coded hex in components.
2. Spacing scale must be consistent across all top-level regions.
3. Typography roles are fixed:
   - page title
   - section title
   - body text
   - metadata text
4. Platform tag colors must keep six-platform mapping unchanged.
5. Sans UI font must load from local bundle (`Vesti Sans UI`) with unicode split (Lexend for Latin, Source Han Sans SC for CJK), not external CDN.

---

## 3. State Rendering Contract

Each Tier B region must define explicit rendering for:
- loading
- empty
- error
- ready

Each Tier C actionable component must define:
- default
- hover
- active
- disabled
- focus-visible

Center action states must define:
- enabled
- disabled_mode_mirror
- disabled_unsupported_tab
- disabled_no_transient
- disabled_unreachable
- loading

---

## 4. Interaction Contract

1. Card click area and action buttons cannot overlap semantics.
2. Reader remains a Threads child flow, not a dock-level destination.
3. Inline edit controls (e.g., title rename) must preserve keyboard flows:
   - Enter: confirm
   - Esc: cancel
4. Destructive actions must keep confirm guard.
5. Copy/open/external actions must keep telemetry hooks where already present.
6. Center logo interaction must stay single-purpose in v1.4 (manual archive only).

---

## 5. Feature Boundary Contract

1. Knowledge base entry is a structural element in Insights header.
2. Compaction trigger belongs to Threads per-thread action.
3. Compaction metrics/history belong to Data dashboard.
4. External links (GitHub/landing) belong to Settings about section.
5. Components must not host cross-domain actions outside these boundaries.

---

## 6. Accessibility Contract

Minimum requirements:
- visible focus ring for keyboard navigation
- aria labels on icon-only buttons
- color contrast must pass practical readability standard for metadata text
- no critical action only discoverable via hover

---

## 7. Responsiveness and Density

- Sidepanel width is constrained, so dense mode must remain readable.
- Multi-line truncation rules must be deterministic (`line-clamp-*` where applicable).
- Metadata rows should not wrap into ambiguous layouts for long titles.
- Center action affordance must remain discoverable in compact height.

---

## 8. Regression Guardrails

Do not regress:
- capture status visibility in Settings
- archive action reachability in Settings/center action
- thread list refresh after `VESTI_DATA_UPDATED`
- insights generate/test action flows
- data export and clear data flows

---

## 9. Deliverables

1. Updated component implementation.
2. Before/after screenshot set by region and Reader child flow.
3. Component diff notes explaining hierarchy or behavior changes.
4. QA evidence package from manual sampling checklist.

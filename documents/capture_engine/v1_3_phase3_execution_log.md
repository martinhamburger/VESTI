# Vesti v1.3 Phase3 Execution Log (Kimi + YUANBAO)

Date: 2026-03-07  
Owner: Engineering  
Status: In progress (rc.6)

---

## 1. Baseline

- Base line: v1.2 governance + v1.3 Phase1/Phase2 completed.
- Identity policy unchanged:
  - no stable session ID => `held/missing_conversation_id`
  - force archive does not bypass missing ID.

---

## 2. Implemented in Phase3

1. Platform scope
   - Added Kimi + YUANBAO in `Platform` unions and distribution/mapping contracts.
2. Host routing
   - Added strict hosts:
     - `kimi.moonshot.cn`
     - `yuanbao.tencent.com`
3. Capture entrypoints
   - Added `frontend/src/contents/kimi.ts` and `frontend/src/contents/yuanbao.ts`.
4. Parser modules
   - Added `KimiParser` / `YuanbaoParser` with selector+anchor strategy, strict session ID extraction, parse stats logging, and v1.2 governance compatibility.
5. UI + capsule mapping
   - Added light/dark tokens and platform mappings for Kimi/YUANBAO.
   - Explicitly preserved Threads layout structure (mapping-only change).

---

## 3. Validation Status

- Static checks:
  - `pnpm -C frontend exec tsc --noEmit` -> pending
- Build:
  - `pnpm -C frontend build` -> pending
- Prompt evaluation:
  - `pnpm -C frontend eval:prompts --mode=mock --strict` -> pending
- Manual sampling checklist:
  - `documents/capture_engine/v1_3_phase3_manual_sampling_checklist.md`

---

## 4. Known Limits / Risks

- Source timestamp extraction remains best-effort and may be `null`.
- Parser selectors are resilient but still sensitive to upstream DOM churn.
- Strict host scope currently limited to the two phase-3 primary domains only.

---

## 5. Go/No-Go Rule

Release is blocked unless:
- Blocker = 0
- Major <= 2 with owner/workaround/retest evidence
